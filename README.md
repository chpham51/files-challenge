Challenge #1 Getting Started with Git

Hello!!

I hope you're having a wonderful summer so far and really appreciate that you've chosen to spend your time teaching us web development instead of going outside! Uhhh, not that I'd mind combining the two...cough cough...Anyways, thank you!

And have a super lovely weekend!!
